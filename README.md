# Challenge-Homework-Two

A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. This last point can't be stressed enough: having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies.
With these points in mind, in this Challenge you'll set yourself up for future success by applying the core skills you've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.

 **User Story**: This is a short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the person who is requesting the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. This follows an AS AN / I WANT / SO THAT format. For example, "AS A shopper visiting an online store, I WANT to place items in a shopping cart, SO THAT I can purchase them."

 **Acceptance Criteria**: These are the requirements that you must meet to satisfy the scope of work. They are not exhaustive, but they do entail the minimum aspects of a working solution. Consider this a checklist of baseline requirements. Acceptance criteria can be presented in various ways. In this case, we'll use a common format called**scenario-oriented criteria** 
 which expresses each requirement in a WHEN / THEN format. Don't worry if this doesn't make sense now; it will become very familiar to you after you complete a couple of Challenges.
    GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
    WHEN I load their portfolio
    THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
    WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
    THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
    WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
    THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
    WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
    THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
    WHEN I click on the images of the applications
    THEN I am taken to that deployed application
    WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
    THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
